# OpenFoundry

**The fastest way to build data products with AI.**

Everyone wants to own their data ‚Äî so why trust a black-box AI to operate on it?

While projects like Apache Iceberg give users control over how data is stored, analytics agents and products remain proprietary and opaque. OpenFoundry is an open-source platform for building data products with AI ‚Äî without giving up control. It‚Äôs fully extensible, easy to customize with organization-specific tools, and designed to work transparently on your data, in your environment.

Take back control ‚Äî not just of your data, but of the agents that work with it.
